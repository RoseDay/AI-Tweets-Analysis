# AI Tweets Analysis

The study is analysis using natural language processing tools and data visualization to find out whether there is a generally positive 
or negative sentiment about artificial intelligence (AI). I found net positive sentiments in the pool of texts and by tweet user.
The two most prevalent sentiments (by the NRC lexicon in R) were trust and fear. I also examined bigrams, especially for negating
pairs. When I used the AFINN lexicon, I found a bimodal distribution of positive and negative sentiments when words were grouped
by user account.
However, the Twitter data extracted did not provide the intended sentiment study for the general Twitter using public. Between 
planning the project and pulling the data, Twitter changed its extraction policy severely limiting the data available to me. 
The tweets were largely from consultants, vendors and other technical interests, as opposed to a more general population had
I been able to select certain dates around newsworthy AI events. Therefore, I could not gauge the sentiments around the public 
discourse or use the data extracted as a training data set that was generalizable.
